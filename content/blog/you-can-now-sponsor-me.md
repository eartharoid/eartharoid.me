**You can now [sponsor me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/eartharoid) or [become a member on Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/eartharoid/tiers).**

The reward tiers are the same for both platforms, but there are some differences:

- Ko‑fi is in GBP, GitHub Sponsors is in USD
- Ko‑fi automatically gives you your Discord role, GitHub Sponsors does not
- Ko‑fi supports PayPal and card, GitHub Sponsors only supports card payments
- GitHub Sponsors will show your sponsorship on your GitHub profile

## Why sponsor me?

Sponsorships cover my costs, allow me to spend more time working on my projects, and also motivate me to continue to support and improve my projects.

## Rewards

Rewards include:

- Discord roles
- Name/avatar/logo in the README of one or more projects
- Name/avatar/logo on the website of one or more projects
- Name/avatar/logo in announcements/releases of one or more projects
- A certificate of awesomeness
