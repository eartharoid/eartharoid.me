Hey, you're reading my blog! I thought it would be cool to have a blog as part of my new website, but I didn't have any plans for the content. I thought about it a little, considered holiday diaries etc, and decided that I don't want it to be too personal, which means it will probably be developer-focused content. Maybe I'll write regularly, or maybe I'll forget about it for a while and write an occasional post about how I made something new.

I don't think I'll use this blog for announcements for my established projects, more for general topics and new projects that may interest more of the 0 people who are going to read it. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
