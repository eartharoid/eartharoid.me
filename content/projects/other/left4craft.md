## About

Left4Craft is a Minecraft server which started in 2013 (I think). I joined in March 2016, and became a Helper in April 2017. About a year later I had risen to Admin and have helped to improve and maintain the server since.

## What I have done

I have helped a bit with the plugins, but I have done much more for the Discord bot and the website.

> I also accidentally deleted the forums in April 2020 whilst updating phpBB, which is why I made a new website for Left4Craft.

## Support

Join the Discord server: [l4c.link/discord](https://l4c.link/discord).
