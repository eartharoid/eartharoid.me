## About me

Hi. I'm Isaac, a 17 year-old student & developer from England. I write code, think about code, procrastinate *(a lot)*, and occasionally do photography. I like making things, both physically and digitally. I find science interesting, *but also sometimes incredibly boring*.

I started messing with code a little in 2016, starting with very basic Node.JS and some basic HTML & CSS only web pages. I have been writing more code every year since, as my GitHub profile shows.

I first tried photography in 2017 and I have been doing a little bit each year, mostly on holidays or day trips to interesting places.

			I'm also known as "eartharoid" an "earth". I created the name "eartharoid" in early 2016 whilst
			thinking of a username for my Steam account. I like space stuff, Earth is my favourite planet, and I
			smashed an incorrectly spelling of asteroid on the end.

### Software

#### My skills

It appears that it is popular to have a list of icons/logos for "skills", so here's mine:

{{< icon fab fa-github fa-2x is-large >}}
{{< icon fab fa-git fa-2x is-large >}}
{{< icon fab fa-node fa-2x is-large >}}
{{< icon fab fa-js fa-2x is-large >}}
{{< icon fab fa-react fa-2x is-large >}}
{{< icon fab fa-vuejs fa-2x is-large >}}
{{< icon fab fa-html5 fa-2x is-large >}}
{{< icon fab fa-css3 fa-2x is-large >}}
{{< icon fab fa-linux fa-2x is-large >}}
{{< icon fab fa-ubuntu fa-2x is-large >}}

Icons that are missing from FontAwesome:

- Visual Studio Code
- TypeScript

##### Programming languages

I've noticed that a lot of apparent portfolio sites have progress bars or numbers representing ability to use the language or tool. I think it's dumb but I made up some numbers anyway.

### Photography

Honestly, I'm not very good at photography. I don't do it very often but I enjoy it. I like doing landscape and wildlife photography the most.

You can view a small collection of some of my best photos in [my gallery](/gallery).
